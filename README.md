# Franchise-Location-Investment-Decision


Site location analysis and franchise territory mapping is a vital part of business success. Locating franchise or any kind of business in the wrong place can cause the business to fail, no matter how many other things are done right. One of the reasons why franchise location is so important, is that it determines the volume of traffic you can attract to your business, and the quality of that traffic. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a very careful location analysis. The objective of this analysis is to find out possible franchise locations considering the nearby business in each location and its types.
